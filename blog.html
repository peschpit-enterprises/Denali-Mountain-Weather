<h1>Alaska's Weather</h1>
<p>Alaska's weather - what will the snowfall be for the winter of 2018?
<img style="float: right" src="http://alaskamountainweather.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Alaska-temp-2018.gif-300x295.png" />
November and December failed to bring typical precipitation to most of Alaska, as the atmospheric river instead fed into the Pacific Northwest and worked to redirect southward some of what could have fallen. The population of about 900 in Talkeetna, AK, a town south (about 60 miles) of Denali, tends to be a good proxy for “general weather patterns) for Denali region. Talkeetna is also a great reference point given the data that is archived. While the state of Washington got soaked, Talkeetna only saw 22% of the typical water equivalent precipitation total (0.36’’) in <a href="http://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=pafc">November<a/>. December was much wetter and snowier but still contributed 17% less than average (1.60’’.) Beyond any possible melting, 1.60’’ inches of precipitation translates to around sixteen inches of snow.
<br/><br/>
<a href="https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/ftpref/support/snow/snowpack_maps/alaska/wy2017/aksnow1701.gif">Snowpack</a> is recorded at various sites, especially in southeastern Alaska. Right now, the best places for snow are central Alaska near Fairbanks and southeastern Alaska near British Columbia, which also saw the Pineapple Express this fall. While there is some snow ready near Anchorage and Denali, totals are presently well short of typical.
<img style="float: left" src="http://alaskamountainweather.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/snow-pack-aksnow1701-232x300.gif" />
<h5>Alaskan Winter 2018 Snowfall</h5>
<p>NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center is projecting that southern Alaskan winter 2018 snowfall will be preserved by moderately colder temperatures, which have already set record daily lows in Canada and the northern mainland US, such as in Minnesota and New York. Mt. Washington in New Hampshire just saw a real temperature of -36F and a wind chill of -94F – about 14F colder than the average surface temperature of Mars.
<img style="float: right" src="http://alaskamountainweather.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/prec-alaska-2018-300x295.png" />
<br/><br/>
Although the stage will be set for snow thermally, the precipitation outlook is suggesting a drier than normal season east of the Aleutian Islands in southern Alaska along the Pacific Ocean. The deficit is projected to favor the coast, with closer to typical conditions expected toward Fairbanks.
<br/><br/>
Northern Alaska will likely be moderately warmer. Extra snow may fall on western Alaska, especially near Russia, where the strongest chance in the United States of a surplus is predicted. Many climbers will be planning for climbs this spring and summer and let us know if we can assist you with our <a href="http://alaskamountainweather.com/our-team/" />custom forecasts</a>.

<h1>Alaska's Weather – Trends in Temperature and Snowpack</h1>
<p>Alaska's Weather - trends in temperature and snowpack. 2016 was a record-shatteringly warm year across much of the northernmost State. <a href="http://climate.gi.alaska.edu/ClimTrends/Change/TempChange.html">Warmer days</a> outnumbered cooler days by a wide margin. Part of the reason was last year’s strong El Niño, which promotes warm surface ocean temperatures near Alaska and a persistent zone of low pressure near or over the Aleutians. Parts of the eastern Bering Sea and the North Pacific experienced record temperatures. Nome’s average annual temperature was recorded as above freezing for the first time.
<br/><br/>
Alaskan environmental data logging began in 1949, so meteorologists have only limited room to claim to have an understanding of the region’s warming and cooling trends. The past six decades have brought roughly <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/features/2016-shatters-record-alaskas-warmest-year">3.0F</a> of warming but the variability of the observed data dulls the significance of the measurement when constructing linear growth projections. Alaskan winters and springs have warmed the most.
<br/><br/>
<img style="float: left" src="http://alaskamountainweather.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/alaskasnow-232x300.gif" />
Mean seasonal and annual changes were more variable before 1976. The only true temperature anomaly since 1977 has been Barrow, Alaska – the United States’ northernmost city. The gradually warmer temperatures felt across Alaska are related to a negative-to-positive phase shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which encourages winterly warm air advection due to a southerly maritime flow.
<br/><br/>
Locals of the Last Frontier are witnessing several environmental changes ultimately due to the phase shift. Last year, sea ice froze two weeks late. River ice broke up at near-record or record times in the Spring. Conditions have been more hospitable for most of the native wildlife. The changes in temperature and humidity are causing tree lines on mountains to rise. Fortunately, sufficient moisture has accompanied the warmth to effectively battle the threat of wildfires.
<br/><br/>
Reduced snowpack is another obvious effect. For instance, Tokositna Valley – a low elevation locale close to Denali – is around 74% of its average depth, compared to nearly 90% in Mar. 2016. Measurements from May 1, near the end of snow season, from earlier this decade indicate the trending shortage in the average snowpack depth: 2010 – 50%; 2011 – 75%; 2012 – 90%; 2013 – 110%; 2014 – less than 50%; 2015 - less than 50%. The years with more snow roughly correspond with the mean annual temperature being colder than throughout most of the past two decades. [<a href"http://climate.gi.alaska.edu/ClimTrends/Location">Explore here</a> for more climate data by location.]
<br/><br/>
Winter 2017’s present pattern will likely persist until Spring. A weak La Niña is encouraging the formation of systems that bring cooler temperatures but warmer temperatures otherwise have paved the way for more spring-like conditions. The two factors should balance each other and continue to make for a fairly typical late winter. Western and northwestern Alaska may be the exceptions, as low sea ice levels can aid the formation of extra precipitation.

<h1>Alaska's Weather - La Nina Impact</h1>
<p> 
Alaska Weather – La Nina Impact. Will the current La Niña affect Alaska’s weather during winter 2017? December has already spawned a large, unseasonably cold air mass over western and central Alaska, which will be pushing southeast into the northwestern United States this week. The pattern is typical during a La Niña winter, wherein the Pacific jet stream heads northward, air masses of relatively high pressure characteristically build over the frigid Alaskan interior and then drain into central North America. The phenomenon, called an Omega block, casts away incoming moist, warmer air, making for a drier and colder winter.
<br/><br/>
The Climate Prediction Center is forecasting above normal temperatures through February in northern, western and southwestern Alaska, especially along the coasts, where warmer energies from the Pacific Ocean bombard the notoriously icy conditions of America’s “Last Frontier.” Models are essentially indifferent regarding what may happen in central and southeastern Alaska. If the weather of early December portends the conditions this winter, the regions may be colder than normal.
<img style="float: left" src="http://alaskamountainweather.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Alaska-temp-300x279.gif" />
Southern Alaska is slated to receive below normal precipitation totals. NOAA suggests the chances for having a below normal, above normal or normal precipitation season are roughly equal elsewhere.
<img style="float: right" src="http://alaskamountainweather.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Prec-Alaska-300x279.jpg" />
</p>
<h5>Spring Weather</h5>
Spring is still very far away for weather models. Regardless, indirect inferences may point to answers. La Niña isn’t slated to linger for long. Given a short-lived La Niña that only lasts through the winter, the transition would yield nearly normal conditions in the Pacific Ocean come spring.
<br/><br/>
The historical record provides an idea of the kind of Alaskan spring that’s typical during nearly normal conditions. El Niño tends to send the jet stream and its affiliated trafficked weather southward, while La Niña tends to send it northward over central Alaska. A receding La Niña progressing toward normality would mean a straightening of the jet stream, sending it into the Gulf of Alaska. The translation allows the transitions brought by typical air masses and fronts to control Alaska’s weather, which are much harder to forecast several months beforehand than continent-spanning, synoptic scale weather patterns. While temperature and precipitation extremes are possible without the influence of the jet stream, incoming systems are more likely to come close to averaging themselves out, manifesting nearly typical conditions.

<h1>Alaska Range Snowfall</h1>
Alaska Range Snowfall is projected to be around average for this winter and we will explain why. This is important for skiers and climbers alike. Skiers are certainly hoping for above normal. The Pacific Ocean is presently in a strong El Niño, with water temperatures near the South American coast well above normal. Typically, such events bring above average temperatures and less precipitation to the Pacific Northwest and areas to the north. Alaska Range Snowfall for this winter is important for those that might be climbing Denali, Mt. Hunter are other popular climbing areas in the Alaska Range in 2016.
<br /><br />
The latest Climate Prediction Center <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/90day/">90-day</a> forecast predicts a little more precipitation than average just south of and into the Alaska Range with temperatures notably above average. The northern and western sections of the Alaska Range are expected to be a little drier than average. It is worthy to note that the CPC’s predictions are typically biased toward the evidences observed from prior weather patterns instead of the math and science embedded into present technologies and the analyses crafted from them. So if you are a skier you do not like this drier than normal snowfall for the Alaska Range. However, if you are a climber perhaps you are happy that some of your climbing areas in the Alaska Range do not get loaded with too much snowfall.
<br /><br />
<img style="float:left" src="http://alaskamountainweather.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Alaska-300x169.jpg"  />
South of the Alaska Range, the Susitna River flows south into the Cook Inlet, an extension of the Pacific Ocean. Overall, the Susitna Basin presently has <a href="http://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/reports/UpdateReport.html?report=Alaska">173%</a> of its average snowpack. Several sites in and nearby the Alaska Range are also observed. At 850’, Tokositna Valley, on the southern side of the Alaska Range about sixty miles south of Denali, has 130%. On the southern side of the northernmost bend of the Alaska Range, Monahan Flat (2,710’) has 143%. Just north of the Cook Inlet, Independence Mine (3,500’) has 193%. Several great resources for examining historical <a href="http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/snow_map.html">data</a> of precipitation in the Alaska Range are available from the US Dept. of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, including up-to-date measurements of the snowpack across Alaska and the US within an <a href="http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/webmap/index.html#elements=&networks=!&states=!&counties=!&hucs=&minElevation=&maxElevation=&elementSelectType=all&activeOnly=true&hucLabels=false&stationLabels=&overlays=&hucOverlays=&mode=data&openSections=parameter,date,elements,location,networks&controlsOpen=true&popup=&base=esriNgwm&lat=62.006&lon=-148.271&zoom=6&dataElement=SNWD&parameter=OBS&frequency=DAILY&duration=I&customDuration=&dayPart=E&year=2015&month=12&day=13&monthPart=E">interactive map</a>. The present measurements are defying the typically drier pattern seen in the Pacific Northwest and areas to the north during a strong El Niño event.

<h1>Alaska Weather Good Government Links</h1>
<p>
Good government links for forecasting Alaska’s weather are available for free online. To enjoy the security of up-to-date, on-demand forecasts, many inquiring climbers prefer to wield a hands-on option by having access to real-time weather data and extrapolations. Enjoy these Alaska Weather Good Government Links.
<br /><br />
The National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center issues <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/610day/fxus06.html">ten to fifteen day outlooks</a> Typically, there is a great deal of uncertainty in these forecasts but they are still one of the best available resources. The most prominent downfall of these publicly-available tools is that they are written using meteorology lingo by meteorologists for meteorologists, so having a layman-friendly interpretation prepared may be preferential.
<br /><br />
The National Weather Service in Fairbanks issues the Mt. McKinley (Denali) <a href="http://pafg.arh.noaa.gov/wmofcst.php?wmo=SXAK49PAFG&type=public">Recreational forecast</a> is issued for base camp and McKinley National Park Airport.

The 500 mb pressure level <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/814day/500mb.php">map</a> (at roughly 18,000 ft.) can help show the general progression of weather systems. High-pressure ridges on the map indicate generally good weather and low-pressure troughs indicate the possibility of inclement weather.
<br /><br />
Hundreds of Alaska’s live <a href="http://avcams.faa.gov/">webcams</a> from airports, beaches and more are found on the easily-accessible FAA Aviation Weather Cam website. Most have perspectives from four different directions and are updated every ten minutes.
<br /><br />
Having access to the tools that meteorologists use doesn’t replace the value of a second opinion given by the customized forecast of an experienced professional. Models are wonderful for analyzing real-time data but are, at best, accurate estimations of what will happen and are often far off target. Wildcards such as the effects of terrain aren’t well resolved by the equations they calculate. Skilled forecast meteorologists know how to steer through model inadequacies and errors to fine-tune predictions when storms are brewing and precision is crucial.

<h1>Custom Forecasts Denali</h1>
<p>Custom Forecasts Denali. After being stranded for days at basecamps with strong winds pounding their tents, many climbers wish to know when storms will subside. The free forecasts available to the public are often unreliable. Curious if the extended forecasts are predicting a break in the weather? What if you’ve already invested a month into your trip and time is running out? Perhaps it’s time to order a custom forecast.
<br /><br />
Getting a custom forecast is sensible, is a small price to pay for a second opinion and can increase your chance of a summit. But, of course, in the realm of weather forecasting, there are no guarantees.
<br /><br />
Our mountain weather forecasting service dates back to the 1980s and covers all of the world’s major climbing areas. We’ve provided forecasts for several peaks in the Alaska Range: Denali, Mount Hunter, Moose’s Tooth (southeast of Denali), and Mount Huntington (also southeast of Denali), to name a few. Over <a href="https://www.westcoastweather.com/our-weather-team/">forty years</a> of experience and expertise is injected into our forecasts.
<br /><br />
Our team brings vast experience analyzing the major numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. What are these NWP models? The first, which was very crude, was finished in the 1920s after two weeks of production. All of it was done by hand. The first computer-generated NWP forecast arrived in the early 1950s.
<br /><br />
Currently there are over twenty-four NWP models and many of them can be rather accurate in the short term. It is up to our experienced professionals to interpret which model is the most accurate for each unique forecast.
<br /><br />
There are several steps to our analysis. First, we monitor which model is performing best. Several NWPs can be seen on one spaghetti plot, which also calculates a mean forecast. If there is little variation between forecasts, there is a high degree of certainty.
<br /><br />
Ensemble forecasts are also available for analysis. These models make minor modifications using updated initial conditions to determine how forecasts should evolve.

<h1>Below Normal Snow for Denali</h1>
<p>Below normal snow for Denali for April and May of 2015. Also warmer temperatures are suggested by the current ENSO forecast. This prediction is from the National Weather Service and is based on current trends and the possible effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation.
<br /><br />
The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is defined by NOAA as a stretch of at least three months wherein the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean remains on average a half degree Celsius (0.9°F) warmer than average. It is determined that “El Niño conditions” exist after seven months. After nine, an “El Niño episode” is declared.
<br /><br />
The thermal oscillation happens at irregular intervals of two to seven years. The time of year that it starts also isn’t very consistent. Translated “The Child,” El Niño was named after Christianity’s Jesus because the warming pattern was typically first noticed by Peruvian fishermen around Christmas.
<br /><br />
The Pacific Ocean is presently favoring the onset of El Niño but the atmosphere is inhibiting it by stunting convection. Excluding areas near the North American coast, the Ocean is relatively warm. The NWS is calculating a 55% probability that El Nino conditions will develop by May.
<br /><br />
The process of evaporation requires latent heat, so heating water intensifies it. The warmer water that characterizes an El Niño event can push upward into the North Pacific far enough for southerly winds to skim it up and deposit it onto Alaska. If El Niño conditions develop, Alaska’s summer may become wetter than presently forecast.
<br /><br />
What kind of weather is on the horizon? Lows presently west of Alaska will make for a moist March but better weather is on its way (see above.)
<br /><br />
These, however, are extended forecasts and there is a degree of error in them. Continuous monitoring of the changing weather is necessary to help erase this error

<h1>Alaskan Superstorms</h1>
<p>Alaska weather can bring superstorms with heavy snow and windy conditions that can become dangerous for climbers. Climbers should get forecasts.Severe tropical weather that forms in the southwestern Pacific Ocean can push northeasterly into the Bering Sea and bombard southern Alaska. In mid-November 2014, Super Typhoon Nuri followed this path and bombed to 924 mb: the lowest pressure ever recorded in the North Pacific. It lost its tropical characteristics as it entered the region but it brought hurricane-force winds and 45-foot tall waves. In Shemya, AK, winds of 97 mph were recorded.

</figure>
<p>However, it doesn’t take a typhoon or “snowicane” to make conditions on the mountains exceptionally dangerous. In May of last year, climber Sylvia Montag was almost done trekking Denali Pass when she fell 1,000 feet and became the first to perish on Mt. McKinley in 2014. She and her partner were 18,200 feet high when conditions grew severely inclement. The weather was very poor but the 62 mph winds she reported on her company’s website were a very different foe than those brought to the southern and western coasts by Nuri and the “snowicane.” Her partner was able to fend off death by enclosing himself within a metal storage locker (National Park Service rescue cache) for the duration.
Three years before, a monster “snowicane” hit the region. The system brought with it winds equivalent to those produced by a Category 4 hurricane. It reportedly blew off roofs of homes in Nome, AK. One coastal observation post reported ice accretion at the rate of 23.5’’ per hour. As with all other storms of this type, the “snowicane” continued inland and greatly disrupted Alaska’s mountain weather.
