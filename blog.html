Alaska Weather- What will the snowfall be for the winter of 2018?
<img style="float: right" src="http://alaskamountainweather.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Alaska-temp-2018.gif-300x295.png" />
November and December failed to bring typical precipitation to most of Alaska, as the atmospheric river instead fed into the Pacific Northwest and worked to redirect southward some of what could have fallen. The population of about 900 in Talkeetna, AK, a town south (about 60 miles) of Denali, tends to be a good proxy for “general weather patterns) for Denali region. Talkeetna is also a great reference point given the data that is archived. While the state of Washington got soaked, Talkeetna only saw 22% of the typical water equivalent precipitation total (0.36’’) in <a href="http://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=pafc">November<a/>. December was much wetter and snowier but still contributed 17% less than average (1.60’’.) Beyond any possible melting, 1.60’’ inches of precipitation translates to around sixteen inches of snow.
<a href="https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/ftpref/support/snow/snowpack_maps/alaska/wy2017/aksnow1701.gif">Snowpack</a> is recorded at various sites, especially in southeastern Alaska. Right now, the best places for snow are central Alaska near Fairbanks and southeastern Alaska near British Columbia, which also saw the Pineapple Express this fall. While there is some snow ready near Anchorage and Denali, totals are presently well short of typical.

<h4>Alaskan Winter 2018 Snowfall</h4>
<p>NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center is projecting that southern Alaskan winter 2018 snowfall will be preserved by moderately colder temperatures, which have already set record daily lows in Canada and the northern mainland US, such as in Minnesota and New York. Mt. Washington in New Hampshire just saw a real temperature of -36F and a wind chill of -94F – about 14F colder than the average surface temperature of Mars.
<img style="float: right" src="http://alaskamountainweather.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/prec-alaska-2018-300x295.png" />
Although the stage will be set for snow thermally, the precipitation outlook is suggesting a drier than normal season east of the Aleutian Islands in southern Alaska along the Pacific Ocean. The deficit is projected to favor the coast, with closer to typical conditions expected toward Fairbanks.
Northern Alaska will likely be moderately warmer. Extra snow may fall on western Alaska, especially near Russia, where the strongest chance in the United States of a surplus is predicted. Many climbers will be planning for climbs this spring and summer and let us know if we can assist you with our <a href="http://alaskamountainweather.com/our-team/" />custom forecasts</a>.

<h1>Alaska Weather – Trends in Temperature and Snowpack</h1>
<p>Alaska Weather- trends in temperature and snowpack. 2016 was a record-shatteringly warm year across much of the northernmost State. <a href="http://climate.gi.alaska.edu/ClimTrends/Change/TempChange.html">Warmer days</a> outnumbered cooler days by a wide margin. Part of the reason was last year’s strong El Niño, which promotes warm surface ocean temperatures near Alaska and a persistent zone of low pressure near or over the Aleutians. Parts of the eastern Bering Sea and the North Pacific experienced record temperatures. Nome’s average annual temperature was recorded as above freezing for the first time.

Alaskan environmental data logging began in 1949, so meteorologists have only limited room to claim to have an understanding of the region’s warming and cooling trends. The past six decades have brought roughly <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/features/2016-shatters-record-alaskas-warmest-year">3.0F</a> of warming but the variability of the observed data dulls the significance of the measurement when constructing linear growth projections. Alaskan winters and springs have warmed the most.

Mean seasonal and annual changes were more variable before 1976. The only true temperature anomaly since 1977 has been Barrow, Alaska – the United States’ northernmost city. The gradually warmer temperatures felt across Alaska are related to a negative-to-positive phase shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which encourages winterly warm air advection due to a southerly maritime flow.

Locals of the Last Frontier are witnessing several environmental changes ultimately due to the phase shift. Last year, sea ice froze two weeks late. River ice broke up at near-record or record times in the Spring. Conditions have been more hospitable for most of the native wildlife. The changes in temperature and humidity are causing tree lines on mountains to rise. Fortunately, sufficient moisture has accompanied the warmth to effectively battle the threat of wildfires.

Reduced snowpack is another obvious effect. For instance, Tokositna Valley – a low elevation locale close to Denali – is around 74% of its average depth, compared to nearly 90% in Mar. 2016. Measurements from May 1, near the end of snow season, from earlier this decade indicate the trending shortage in the average snowpack depth: 2010 – 50%; 2011 – 75%; 2012 – 90%; 2013 – 110%; 2014 – less than 50%; 2015 - less than 50%. The years with more snow roughly correspond with the mean annual temperature being colder than throughout most of the past two decades.

Winter 2017’s present pattern will likely persist until Spring. A weak La Niña is encouraging the formation of systems that bring cooler temperatures but warmer temperatures otherwise have paved the way for more spring-like conditions. The two factors should balance each other and continue to make for a fairly typical late winter. Western and northwestern Alaska may be the exceptions, as low sea ice levels can aid the formation of extra precipitation.

<h1>Alaska's Weather - La Nina Impact</h1>
<p> 
Alaska Weather – La Nina Impact. Will the current La Niña affect Alaska’s weather during winter 2017? December has already spawned a large, unseasonably cold air mass over western and central Alaska, which will be pushing southeast into the northwestern United States this week. The pattern is typical during a La Niña winter, wherein the Pacific jet stream heads northward, air masses of relatively high pressure characteristically build over the frigid Alaskan interior and then drain into central North America. The phenomenon, called an Omega block, casts away incoming moist, warmer air, making for a drier and colder winter.

The Climate Prediction Center is forecasting above normal temperatures through February in northern, western and southwestern Alaska, especially along the coasts, where warmer energies from the Pacific Ocean bombard the notoriously icy conditions of America’s “Last Frontier.” Models are essentially indifferent regarding what may happen in central and southeastern Alaska. If the weather of early December portends the conditions this winter, the regions may be colder than normal.

Southern Alaska is slated to receive below normal precipitation totals. NOAA suggests the chances for having a below normal, above normal or normal precipitation season are roughly equal elsewhere.

</p>
<h4>Spring Weather</h4>
Spring is still very far away for weather models. Regardless, indirect inferences may point to answers. La Niña isn’t slated to linger for long. Given a short-lived La Niña that only lasts through the winter, the transition would yield nearly normal conditions in the Pacific Ocean come spring.

The historical record provides an idea of the kind of Alaskan spring that’s typical during nearly normal conditions. El Niño tends to send the jet stream and its affiliated trafficked weather southward, while La Niña tends to send it northward over central Alaska. A receding La Niña progressing toward normality would mean a straightening of the jet stream, sending it into the Gulf of Alaska. The translation allows the transitions brought by typical air masses and fronts to control Alaska’s weather, which are much harder to forecast several months beforehand than continent-spanning, synoptic scale weather patterns. While temperature and precipitation extremes are possible without the influence of the jet stream, incoming systems are more likely to come close to averaging themselves out, manifesting nearly typical conditions.
