<p>Greetings! This is Associate Meteorologist for West Coast Weather Geoff Linsley, coming to you with five years of professional experience forecasting the weather of the West Coast but, today, as a private consultant branching off into a separate, new project.

<br /><br />
Why pay for forecasts? There is seldom much value in a free mountain weather forecast. Automated computer models can provide data for all locations but they can’t consider the big picture: the weather dynamics of the surrounding areas, i.e. major troughs, cyclones forming in the Gulf of Alaska or the jet stream. Beyond geolocational data from automated systems, I examine tools such as forecast ensembles, skew-T diagrams, verification data, the ECMWF (European), the US GFS, the Global Canadian, the Global German, the UKMET (British) and local models.

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Several potential money and time-saving benefits open up by trusting me with your forecasting. Getting a second opinion regarding flight decisions could save lives, as well as costs related to abandoning a mission due to the weather. All air taxi operators need to keep an eye on the weather. Why devote half an hour or more of work time per day to monitoring the weather when all that need be done is to look at a report a couple minutes long prepared specifically for your company? What I’m offering is the custom tailored benefits of an in-house Meteorologist for a tiny fraction of the cost of a full-time hire.
<br /><br />
Already trusting a Meteorologist to cater to your weather forecasting needs? I likely can offer fairer prices to do just as good or better work. Please contact me at geoff@geofflinsley.com.
