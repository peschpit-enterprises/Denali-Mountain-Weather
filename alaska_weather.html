<h1>Alaska's Weather</h1>
<article> Mountainous, majestic and speckled with lakes, Alaska is America’s biggest hidden gem. It spans over 375 million acres (twice the size of Texas) and thus has very diverse weather patterns. For instance, Alaskan weather in May or June is vastly different than even in March.

Four major mountain ranges shape Alaska’s weather. The Brooks Range separates the Arctic from the Alaskan interior. The Alaska-Aleutian range extends from the western Aleutian Islands, along the Alaska Peninsula, northward a couple hundred miles and then eastward into Canada. Its western section is known as the Aleutian Range and its eastern section is the Alaska Range. Also notable are the Chugach Mountains, north of the Gulf of Alaska, and the Wrangell Mountains northeast of them, under the Alaska Range. Alaska is home to America’s tallest mountain, Mt. McKinley (20,320 ft.), which is found toward the middle of the Alaska Range.

The climate in Alaska is best divided into five regions. The southern part, from the western Aleutian Islands to southeastern Alaska, is a region mainly influenced by warmer, moist air from the Pacific Ocean. Another region influenced by the Pacific, exists along the west coast next to the Bering Sea, where summer temperatures are capped by the cooler ocean air but winter temperatures remain more bearable. In the center of the state between the Brooks Range and the Alaska-Aleutian Range lies the continental region. Between it and the coastal regions there is a transitional zone with its own climatic characteristics. Finally, to the north there exists an arctic drainage region covered in permafrost.

Many places in Alaska, however, have weather that isn’t so easily categorized. Orientations of mountains relative to the average regional weather flow, local snow cover, ice cover, how high the sun rises, average wind speeds, elevation, and proximity to the Pacific Ocean greatly affect the weather that any specific location receives, making customized, localized forecasts necessary for increased accuracy.

Alaska’s size, coastlines and tall mountain ranges make it the state with the fourth highest temperature variability. The average annual temperature is around 40°F along the southern coast and only 10°F along the northern coast. Inland in the continental zone, annual temperatures can range from 100°F to minus 50°F.

Along the Gulf of Alaska, the State receives around 150 inches of precipitation per year (rainfall + the rainfall equivalent of snowfall.) <figure id="float">

In the southeastern maritime region, the combination of plentiful incoming moisture and the air damming done by the coastal mountains yields around 200 inches. The upward motion of the air as it pushes over the mountains causes increased precipitation along their windward sides. In the continental zone, between the Alaska Range and the arctic region, only a foot of precipitation is expected annually. Just to the north, above the Arctic Transition Zone, less than half a foot falls.

Most of Alaska’s windy and exceptionally dangerous storms frequent the southern coast and coastal islands. Strong oceanic storms have been known to bring winds in excess of 130 mph to the islands, which also manifests severe flooding. This is partially due to the “Aleutian Low” that commonly develops over the region, which is a nursery for bad weather.
