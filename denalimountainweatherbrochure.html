<h1>DENALI MOUNTAIN WEATHER</h1>
<article>
<p>Head Meteorologist for Denali Mountain Weather, Michael Fagin has been forecasting major global climbing venues for over 16 years: Mt. Everest, K2, Denali, Mt. Hunter and Aconcagua, to name a few. Teaming with his expertise are associate Meteorologists Dr. Mike Witiw and Geoff Linsley. Our services are <a href="http://alaskamountainweather.com/our-clients/">trusted</a> by high profile <a href="https://everestweather.com/our-clients/">clients</a> worldwide.
<br /><br />
Why pay for forecasts? There is seldom much value in a free mountain weather forecast. Automated computer models can provide data for Mt. Denali’s exact coordinates but they can’t consider the big picture: the weather dynamics of the surrounding areas, i.e. major troughs, cyclones forming in the Gulf of Alaska or the jet stream. Beyond geolocational data from automated systems, we examine tools such as forecast ensembles, skew-T diagrams, verification data, the ECMWF (European), the US GFS, the Global Canadian, the Global German, the UKMET (British) and local models.

<br /><br />
A Denali Mountain Weather forecast is firstmost custom tailored to the needs of the climber or climbing expedition group. Forecasts for requested details, as well as phone consultations, are made readily available throughout every journey. In addition to using telephones, we’ve used whatever technology our clients have prefered, i.e. SMS messages to satellite phones or emails, inReach (Garmin), text to cell or WhatsApp. Every forecast looks ahead 7 days and includes: temperatures, clouds, precipitation, wind speeds and directions. Forecasts are provided for each camp: Camp 1 (7800’), Camp 2 (11,200’), Camp 3 (14,200’), High Camp (17,200’) and the summit.
<br /><br />
Several potential money and time-saving benefits make our Denali forecasting package a good idea. Planning the right time to climb can both save lives and reduce the chances of quitting and turning back. We help pick the best summit window to maximize your odds of safely reaching the peak: daily forewarnings detailed by our 7-day forecasts. Acting on the foreknowledge that conditions likely won’t be safe or desirable can prevent losses such as expenses from planning a future trip to try again and days of wasted time.
